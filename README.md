# Maze Runner
Test your maze generation algorithms, both for finite and infinite mazes.
Simply write some JavaScript that declares the function `getWalls(x,y)` which returns
an enum with the walls of the cell at position (x,y). The grid and tests will already
be provided for you.

## Notes
- YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CODE YOU PASTE! This project is meant to execute arbitrary code, 
  and it will! Do not paste code you don't understand or trust.
- For infinite mazes, the order is not guaranteed. Use of recursion is suggested.
